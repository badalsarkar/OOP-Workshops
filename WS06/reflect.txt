The first thing that I learned from this lab is that we need to deallocate each element in the container if any memory was allocated. In our case, we had objects that had to be
deallocated. However what I found interesting was that just clearing the vector did not deallocate the memory. Also, we could have used only vectors or lists as they both are
containers for holding our objects. One main difference is that Vectors have contiguous storage while the list is not contiguous.
